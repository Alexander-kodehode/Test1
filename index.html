    <h1>Programming</h1>
    <h3>What is programming?</h3>
    
    <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. 
        You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand. </p>

    <h3>How does programming work?</h3>
    <p>At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. 
        First, a programmer writes codeâ€”a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. 
        Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. 
        Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. 
        Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text. </p>
